This is a program that simulates vacuum cleaning robots with different functions. In order to more fully understand design pattern applications in Python 3, Iâ€™ve incorporated the following design patterns: 
- Abstract Factory and Builder to simplify the creation process of that simulates different types of cleaning robots
- Singleton as the global 2D array used to simulate different room sizes
- Observer, used to manage the overall cleaning progress.
